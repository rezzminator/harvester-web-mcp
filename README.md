# harvester

A multi-format MCP **fetch + search** server. It converts web pages, PDFs, Office documents,
archives, and local files to clean Markdown; resolves scholarly identifiers (DOI/ISBN/title) to a
free, legal full-text copy; caches every artifact on disk under a type-partitioned `.fetch/` tree;
and escalates through a four-stage wall-bypass ladder before surfacing an error.

> [!CAUTION]
> This server can access local files and local/internal IP addresses, and it reaches out to the
> open web. It may represent a security risk. Run it with the least privilege you can, and ensure it
> does not expose sensitive data. (Credential and key files are refused — see
> [Local-path support](#local-path-support-and-deny-paths).)

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp>
- **Package name:** `harvester-mcp` (not yet on PyPI — install from source or from GitHub)
- **Command / module:** `harvester` (`python -m harvester`)

## What it does

**One API, many formats.** Pass a URL, a local path, or a scholarly identifier — `harvester`
detects the format, routes it to the right converter, caches the Markdown result, and returns the
full content. A second call on the same input is served from cache with no refetch.

**Wall-bypass ladder.** For an HTML page the server tries four methods in order, stopping as soon
as it gets rich content:

1. **httpx** — standard HTTP with trafilatura extraction (`favor_recall`); article images are
   downloaded locally and `![](remote)` links are rewritten to local cache paths.
2. **curl_cffi Chrome impersonation** — replays a real Chrome TLS/JA3 fingerprint; bypasses many
   bot-detection CDNs.
3. **Jina Reader** (`https://r.jina.ai/<url>`) — external headless extraction; skipped for
   private/internal hosts.
4. **Open-access mirror** — extracts a DOI from the URL (or scrapes a `citation_pdf_url` /
   `citation_doi` meta tag from the blocked landing page), then resolves through Europe PMC PDF →
   PMC article HTML → the full open-access chain (Unpaywall, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, CORE,
   DOAJ, arXiv/OSF) → a Wayback Machine snapshot. This is the headline path for walled academic
   publishers.

PDF/Office/archive downloads share the spirit of the ladder: an empty or 403 download is retried
with curl_cffi impersonation, and a walled publisher PDF URL that carries an extractable DOI pivots
to the open-access mirror before giving up. A `.pdf` URL that serves an HTML wall page instead of a
PDF is not a dead end either: the (already-downloaded) HTML is scraped for a `citation_pdf_url` /
`citation_doi` tag and that candidate is tried before the mirror chain; a PDF that downloads fine
but converts to empty text (scanned/corrupt) also pivots to the mirror chain before erroring, on
the theory that a bad copy at one URL doesn't mean no open-access copy exists anywhere.

Hard IP-reputation blocks (publisher DRM, a paywall requiring authentication) are not solvable
without a residential exit node — that is out of scope, and the server surfaces a clear error
message when it applies.

## Format matrix

| Input | Converter | Cache subdir |
|---|---|---|
| Web page / HTML | trafilatura (`favor_recall`; image refs kept as URLs) | `.fetch/html/` |
| PDF URL or file (header-sniffed for extensionless URLs) | pymupdf4llm | `.fetch/pdf/` |
| DOCX, XLSX, PPTX | Docling | `.fetch/docx/` `.fetch/xlsx/` `.fetch/pptx/` |
| CSV | MarkItDown | `.fetch/csv/` |
| JSON | literal pretty-print in a ` ```json ``` ` block | `.fetch/json/` |
| Image (JPG/PNG/GIF/WebP/BMP/SVG/TIFF) | saved locally, path returned for vision | `.fetch/<ext>/` |
| Archive (.zip / .tar(.gz/.bz2/.xz) / .7z / .rar) | safe listing, member on request | `.fetch/<kind>/` |
| Archive member — call `archive(source, member="path/to/member")` (internally addressed `source::member`) | routed by member extension | `.fetch/archive_member/` |
| Local path or `file://` URL | same routing, no network | same tree |

**Images:** `fetch` never downloads image binaries and never OCRs — `![](remote-url)` references
are left as URLs in the Markdown. To VIEW a figure, pass its URL to the `fetchImage` tool, which
saves the bytes locally and returns a path readable by vision tools.

**Header-sniff routing:** content-type and magic bytes override the URL extension, so
`https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762` (no `.pdf`) is correctly routed to pymupdf4llm. A `.pdf` URL
that actually serves an HTML wall is rejected rather than fed to the PDF parser as a silent wrong
document.

**DOI / ISBN fast-path:** bare DOIs (`10.xxxx/...`), `doi:` prefixes, `doi.org` URLs, bare ISBNs
and `isbn:` strings skip the HTTP ladder and go straight to the open-access resolver. Bare
PMID/PMCID identifiers resolve through Europe PMC as well.

---

## Tools

The server exposes six tools (`search` appears only when a search backend is configured — see
below).

### `fetch`

Converts one or many **sources** to clean Markdown, returned in input order.

- `sources` (array of strings, **required**, 1–50 items) — each item is a **location** (web URL,
  local path, or `file://` URL → web page / PDF / DOCX / XLSX / PPTX / CSV / JSON) or an
  **unambiguous identifier** (a DOI as `10.xxxx/…`, `doi:…`, or a `doi.org` URL; a book as
  `isbn:9780262300988` or a bare ISBN; a PMID or PMCID). Identifiers are resolved to a free, legal
  copy and then converted. Mix kinds in one batch; a failing item returns a descriptive per-item
  error naming the next tool/argument to try, and the rest still return.
- `size_only` (boolean, optional, default **false**) — when true, fetch + cache the full content as
  normal but return only `{size, chars, path}` per source (`size` = estimated TOKENS via an
  over-counting heuristic, `chars` = raw character count, `path` = cache file). Reuses the same
  cache entry a normal fetch would (no duplicate download); slice the cached `path` from disk.

`fetch` returns document Markdown only (image references left as URLs). Pass it an image, an archive,
or a bare title and it points you at the right sibling tool (`fetchImage`, `archive`, `findWorks`)
instead of guessing. Each result carries a short header (source, cache_status, method, bytes,
tokens, fetched_at, cache path) followed by the content. Content past
`HARVESTER_MAX_INLINE_CHARS` is truncated inline with a note naming the cache path and the char
offset to resume from — the cache file always holds the COMPLETE text, truncated or not.

### `findWorks`

The scholarly counterpart of web search: a TITLE or free-text bibliographic query → a ranked list
of candidate works (papers + books), each with a ready-to-use `fetch:` handle. It downloads
nothing — you pick a candidate and pass its handle to `fetch` (the `findWorks → fetch` pattern). Papers
come from OpenAlex; books from Open Library + Project Gutenberg.

- `query` (string, **required**) — a paper/book title or free-text query.
- `limit` (integer, optional, default **8**, range 1–25) — maximum candidate works to return.

### `search`

An open-web search — title · URL · snippet · engine — to triage; retrieve the URLs you want with
`fetch` (the `search → fetch` pattern). Returns links and snippets, not cleaned content.

- `query` (string, **required**) — the web search query.
- `count` (integer, optional, default **8**, range 1–20) — maximum results.
- `lang` (string, optional, default `""`) — language/locale to bias the search (e.g. `zh`, `ja`,
  `pt-BR`); routes the query to that language's native engines to reach non-English literature.
- `engines` (string, optional, default `""`) — comma-separated SearXNG engines to restrict to
  (e.g. `google,brave` or `naver,yahoo`). Omit for the default aggregated set.

**Backends (see [Web search](#web-search)):** the tool is shown only when a backend is configured.

### `fetchImage`

Fetches one or many images and returns their LOCAL FILE PATHS to read with vision — figures,
photos, charts, scanned pages. Images are saved, not OCR'd; open the returned path to see the
content.

- `sources` (array of strings, **required**, 1–50 items) — image URLs or local image paths. Each
  is saved under `.fetch/<ext>/` (e.g. `.fetch/png/`, `.fetch/jpg/`) and its path is returned in
  order.

### `archive`

Safely browses a single archive — `.zip` / `.tar(.gz/.bz2/.xz)` / `.7z` / `.rar` — by URL or local
path. Two-step, like `findWorks → fetch`.

- `source` (string, **required**) — URL or local path of the archive.
- `member` (string, optional, default `null`) — omit to get the SAFE member listing (names + sizes;
  nothing is extracted to disk). Give a member name from that listing to fetch just that member,
  converted to Markdown. Path-traversal and symlink members are refused; member-count/size caps are
  enforced; the archive is never auto-extracted.

### `searchCache`

Searches every page already cached under `.fetch/` for a regex pattern — recall what you have
already fetched without re-crawling. It locates WHICH cached pages match; it does not return their
text. Returns each hit's source URL, match count, a sample line, and the cached `md_path` — `fetch`
the source again (served from cache) or read `md_path` directly for the content.

- `pattern` (string, **required**) — regex pattern.
- `max_results` (integer, optional, default **50**, range 1–1000) — maximum matching pages.
- `ignore_case` (boolean, optional, default **true**) — case-insensitive search.

---

## Prompts

- `fetch` — fetch a URL or local path and return its extracted Markdown, rendered the same way as
  the `fetch` tool (header + truncation note on success, a descriptive error naming the next move
  on failure). Argument: `url` (required). Images/archives redirect to `fetchImage`/`archive`,
  same as the tool.

---

## Web search

The `search` tool has two backends. It is **always advertised** so MCP clients see a stable
six-tool surface; with no backend configured a call returns a clear "set `SEARXNG_URL` /
`BRAVE_API_KEY`" message instead of the tool vanishing mid-session.

- **`SEARXNG_URL`** (primary) — base URL of a self-hosted [SearXNG](https://searxng.org)
  (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8888`). Free, self-hosted, aggregates 200+ engines (less single-engine /
  SEO bias than a plain Google search), and routes per-language to regional engines — the
  multilingual lever behind the `lang` / `engines` parameters.
- **`BRAVE_API_KEY`** (managed fallback) — a Brave Search API token, used when SearXNG is
  unconfigured, down, or blocked for a locale.
- **`HARVESTER_DISABLE_SEARCH`** — set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` to force-hide the `search` tool
  entirely, for deployments that want no web search at all.

The tool runs when `SEARXNG_URL` and/or `BRAVE_API_KEY` is set (SearXNG first, then Brave); it is
listed regardless unless `HARVESTER_DISABLE_SEARCH` is truthy.

---

## Local-path support and deny-paths

Local files and `file://` URLs are fully supported, routed by the same detector with no network
access. Credential and key files are refused — the deny list covers:

- **Directories:** `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.password-store`, `.docker`.
- **Names:** `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `credentials`, `.netrc`, `.pgpass`,
  `.htpasswd`, `shadow`, `master.key`.
- **Suffixes:** `.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.pfx`, `.keystore`, `.jks`, `.asc`, `.gpg`, `.kdbx`,
  `.ppk`, `.env` (and `.env.*`), plus any name containing a private-key marker
  (`_rsa`, `_ed25519`, `_dsa`, `_ecdsa`).

The check runs on both a path and its symlink target, so an innocently named symlink can't smuggle
a secret. Outbound web fetches also apply an SSRF guard that refuses private / internal / link-local
hosts (including obfuscated IP forms).

---

## Cache

The cache lives at `.fetch/` at the project root (the directory containing `pyproject.toml`),
overridable with `WEBFETCH_DIR`. Every artifact is type-partitioned:

```
.fetch/
  html/<slug>__<sha1>.md
  pdf/<slug>__<sha1>.md       (and the source .pdf alongside)
  docx/  xlsx/  pptx/  csv/  json/
  png/   jpg/   gif/   webp/  …     (images and image-bearing kinds)
  archive_member/<slug>__<sha1>.md
```

Slugs are filesystem-safe and suffixed with a 10-char SHA-1 of the input for collision safety.
Failing fetches are held in a short-lived in-memory negative cache (default 120 s, see
`HARVESTER_NEG_TTL`) so a dead source is not re-hammered; a repeat call inside the window returns
the same error annotated with the seconds remaining before a retry is worth attempting. A
transient failure (timeout, connection error, or an HTTP 429) instead gets the much shorter
`HARVESTER_NEG_TTL_TRANSIENT` window, since it's likely to clear up on its own soon. A DOI-type
input is canonicalized before it hits the cache, so a bare DOI, a `doi:` prefix, and a
`https://doi.org/…` URL for the same work share one entry instead of each independently
re-running (and re-failing) the same open-access chain. Concurrent calls for the same input share
a single in-flight fetch.

A successful fetch that needed more than one rescue attempt (e.g. the initial request was
walled and curl_cffi impersonation or the open-access mirror chain won instead) records which
rungs were tried in the cache frontmatter and the result header (`rungs: direct,
chrome-impersonation, ...`); a terminal error names every rung it walked before giving up, so a
dead source's error is itself the evidence that re-fetching won't help.

## Installation

The package is **not yet published to PyPI**. Install from source or straight from GitHub.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp
cd harvester-web-mcp
uv sync            # install dependencies into the local venv
uv run harvester   # run the server (stdio)
```

### From GitHub

```bash
# run without cloning
uvx --from git+https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp harvester

# or install into an environment
pip install git+https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp
python -m harvester
```

### Once published to PyPI

```bash
uvx --from harvester-mcp harvester     # or: pip install harvester-mcp
```

---

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client config (the `git+https` form needs no clone):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harvester": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp", "harvester"]
    }
  }
}
```

To relocate the cache and enable web search, pass environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harvester": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/rezzminator/harvester-web-mcp", "harvester"],
      "env": {
        "WEBFETCH_DIR": "/path/to/cache",
        "SEARXNG_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBFETCH_DIR` | `.fetch/` at project root | Relocate the on-disk cache. |
| `HARVESTER_MAX_INLINE_CHARS` | `50000` | Cap on the Markdown returned inline per source; the cache file always holds the full text (read the returned path for everything). |
| `HARVESTER_NEG_TTL` | `120` | Seconds a failed fetch is remembered in the negative cache. |
| `HARVESTER_NEG_TTL_TRANSIENT` | `15` | Shorter negative-cache TTL for a transient failure (timeout, connection error, HTTP 429). |
| `HARVESTER_PDF_OCR` | off | Run Tesseract OCR on image-only PDF pages (slow; off by default for fast text-layer extraction). |
| `HARVESTER_PDF_LAYOUT` | off | Run the pymupdf4llm layout model for higher table/heading fidelity (slow). |
| `HARVESTER_LOG_FILE` | unset | Write logs to this file. |
| `HARVESTER_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log level. |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | empty | Self-hosted SearXNG base URL — primary `search` backend (enables the tool). |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | empty | Brave Search API token — fallback `search` backend (enables the tool). |
| `HARVESTER_DISABLE_SEARCH` | off | Force-hide the `search` tool even when a backend is configured. |
| `HARVESTER_CONTACT_EMAIL` | **empty** | Polite-pool contact for scholarly APIs (Crossref / Unpaywall / NCBI). Empty by default, so the published tool sends **no** contact; operators opt in. When set, it is sent as a `mailto:` UA suffix and `?email=` / `?mailto=` parameter — better rate limits, never required. |
| `CORE_API_KEY` | empty | Optional [CORE](https://core.ac.uk) API key. |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | empty | Optional Semantic Scholar API key. |
| `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` | empty | Optional Google Books API key. |

Every scholarly source works **keyless** — the optional API keys only raise rate limits and
full-text coverage; nothing is hard-gated behind a key.

### CLI flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--user-agent <UA>` | Override the default User-Agent (`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; harvester/1.0)`). |
| `--proxy-url <URL>` | Route all outbound requests through this proxy (e.g. `http://proxy:8080`). |
| `--ignore-robots-txt` | No-op, kept for compatibility — robots.txt is never enforced. |
